    "The design of wireless networks, such as cell phone networks, involves assigning communication frequencies to devices. These communication frequencies can be separated into channels. The geographical area covered by a network can be divided into hexagonal cells, where each cell has a base station that covers a given area. Each cell requires a different number of channels, based on usage statistics and each cell has a set of neighbor cells, based on the geographical distances. The design of an efficient mobile network involves selecting subsets of channels for each cell, avoiding interference between calls in the same cell and in neighboring cells. Also, for economical reasons, the total bandwidth in use must be minimized, i.e., the total number of different channels used. One of the first real cases discussed in literature are the Philadelphia [Ande73] instances, with the structure depicted bellow:"

    "Each cell has a demand with the required number of channels drawn at the center of the hexagon, and a sequential id at the top left corner. Also, in this example, each cell has a set of at most 6 adjacent neighboring cells (distance 1). The largest demand (8) occurs on cell 2. This cell has the following adjacent cells, with distance 1: (1, 6). The minimum distances between channels in the same cell in this example is 3 and channels in neighbor cells should differ by at least 2 units.\n",
