    "The Resource-Constrained Project Scheduling Problem (RCPSP) is a combinatorial optimization problem that consists of finding a feasible scheduling for a set of 𝑛 jobs subject to resource and precedence constraints. Each job has a processing time, a set of successors jobs and a required amount of different resources. Resources may be scarce but are renewable at each time period. Precedence constraints between jobs mean that no jobs may start before all its predecessors are completed. The jobs must be scheduled non-preemptively, i.e., once started, their processing cannot be interrupted.\n",
    "\n",
    "The RCPSP has the following input data:\n",

    "amount of resource 𝑟 required for processing job 𝑗\n",

    "capacity of renewable resource 𝑟\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to the jobs that belong to the project, the set  contains jobs 0 and 𝑛+1, which are dummy jobs that represent the beginning and the end of the planning, respectively. The processing time for the dummy jobs is always zero and these jobs do not consume resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "A binary programming formulation was proposed by Pritsker et al. [PWW69]. In this formulation, decision variables 𝑥𝑗𝑡=1 if job 𝑗 is assigned to begin at time 𝑡; otherwise, 𝑥𝑗𝑡=0. All jobs must finish in a single instant of time without violating precedence constraints while respecting the amount of available resources. The model proposed by Pristker can be stated as follows:"
